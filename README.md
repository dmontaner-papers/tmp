1. I copied the original images in the `images_raw` folder.
2. I used GIMP to cut each of the images and save to `.png` files in the `images_raw` folder.
3. `d010_resize_images.py` resizes all cut images and saves them to folder `docs/images`
4. I use `d020_capture_rectangles_for_overlay.py` to capture all the outer rectangualr regions with the labels.

d030_scale_regions.py
d040_capture_regions_for_overlay.py
